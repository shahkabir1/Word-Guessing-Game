A simple word guessing game, similar to Hangman, that I created using my knowledge in Python. The game utilizes a system with lives, where you have 6 lives to guess what the given word is. I chose a txt file I found online to source the words that are utilized in the game, however a different text file can be used to play this game.

Here is the link to the txt file I used: https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000
